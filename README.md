### Hardware & Software Developer
Mechatronics Engineering student with hands-on experience in embedded systems, programming, and practical engineering solutions. My academic background combines electronics, control systems, and software, enabling me to take projects from concept to real-world implementation.

I have worked with **Arduino, ESP microcontrollers, and Raspberry Pi**, developing projects that involve sensor integration, actuator control, data processing, and system automation. I also had the opportunity to participate in and present a project at the **National Khwarizmi Exhibition**, which strengthened my practical experience, teamwork, and problem-solving skills.

On the software side, I am proficient in **Python** and use it to develop engineering tools, practical applications, and automation scripts. I work comfortably in **Linux** environments and have solid experience with **Bash scripting** for task automation, system management, and workflow optimization.

**Skills & Expertise:**

* Embedded Systems: Arduino, ESP (ESP8266 / ESP32), Raspberry Pi
* Programming: Python
* Operating Systems: Linux
* Scripting: Bash
* Mechatronics & Electronics: sensors, actuators, hardware–software integration
* Version Control & Collaboration: Git, GitHub
